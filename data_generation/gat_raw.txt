Ananya Harish
Master's student at Hochschule Darmstadt
I belong to the 2015-19 batch and was a student of Electrical and Electronics Engineering department. Both the lecturers and the staff of our department have always been helpful and supportive of the students. While I was a student, I was fortunate to participate in IEEE International conference, IEEE events, technical workshops and other cultural activities and fests. We as students also had the privilege of becoming IEEE members and were able to access IEEE research papers and ideas with ease. Not just the technical events, but the lectures were also very informative and educative. The lecturers are so friendly that till date I am in contact with them. Overall I have had an amazing experience with GAT EEE department.

I graduated from ECE Department, Global Academy of Technology in 2019. Firstly, the kind of atmosphere created by the faculty and the HOD in our wing is very warm and welcoming. The support provided by each member of our faculty is immense and reached out to every student of our department. The environment created by the faculty is the ideal type of environment required for a student to excel. From my personal experience I would like to note that any member of the department is easy to approach and are willing to clarify student's doubts and solve his/ her issue. Certain times when I couldn’t figure out few things taught inside the class, the teachers were readily available even after college hours to get my doubts clarified. I feel the perfect blend of friendliness and professionalism is the winning formula of our department. Me, being a trained dancer, myself was given all the support from my faculty and HOD to actively participate in many cultural programs. Students who were good at sports were also given the same support. During our department fest, Resonance, all the students are given a chance to showcase their technical as well as cultural abilities. With constant support and encouragement from our department, I was able to do a paper presentation, participate actively in placement drives, participate in all cultural activities and balance everything along with scoring good grades.

```Message From Trustee Secretary
Greetings to all!
Being part of the core Management Team of National Education Foundation for nearly two decades, I have seen the progress at GAT, Rajarajeshwarinagar from its inception and it fills my heart with pride to see where we are. With my engineering qualification background, I have been able to strategize the set-up of the majestic infrastructure for the college. Our aim is to provide the right ambience for overall personality development of the students.
Competition is prevalent in every field and is a way of life in today’s time. As a senior member of the management team, I strongly believe that we prepare our students not only to be globally competitive but to succeed in the chosen discipline. Having grown into a premier, highly sought-after engineering and management institution, GAT has created a significant niche among institutions delivering professional education that is sound, robust, and multi-faceted. Excellence and Quality are our watchwords, reflected in our highly conducive and serene learning ambience.
We also want to make faculty teaching and research, student projects relevant to the practical world. Our objective is to increase the understanding of the issues related to the development of technology and research and share the knowledge with institutions beyond the academic world. We want to embrace best global practices in establishing industrial tie ups, research, and innovation. Through our established R & D centers in every department, we would like to facilitate our research scholar interaction and collaboration between research groups and industry. This will enable whole new vista of opportunities to engage our students in cutting-edge multi-disciplinary project and research, further enhancing their career readiness.
I assure you that @GAT, students will be equipped with the most updated knowledge coupled with highest level of practical training. Our dedicated staff and dynamic management strive to transfer holistic knowledge and make students global citizens. We nurture individuals to leverage technology and continuously explore all means and methods for holistic development of our students.
I extend warm greetings to all the students into GAT, to come, learn, experience and ‘Grow Ahead of Time’. It is my privilege to be part of this triumphant journey where we continue to pave the way for all round development of the students
My Best Wishes to all

Message From Additional Trustee Secretary
As a co-founder and part of the core Management Team of National Education Foundation for nearly two decades now, I take immense pride in the progress made by GAT which is run under the aegis of NEF. I have seen the development of the Institution from its nascent stage to the present status. Originally the place was a hilly terrain. We have contributed our time and energy in converting the terrain into lush green educational campus by planting more than 10000 plants and trees of different varieties. Our aim is to provide salubrious climate and serene atmosphere for holistic development of the students. The landscape provided by us has been greatly appreciated by all who visit our campus. We have also constructed great infrastructure and implemented an impeccable system of administration for the College.
I congratulate the students and their parents for having chosen GAT, which will provide a lifetime advantage in their chosen endeavours. I am proud to say that the student population of more than 3500 students, truly reflects the trust and confidence that the parents and students have bestowed on us
I welcome each student to this portal of learning, where excellence and peak performance is our dialect. Discovering unexplored talents and nurturing them effectively are the driving force of GAT. I am happy to state that the intricately intertwined teaching learning process and human resources has been the focus of education in GAT during its 18 years of existence. Encouraging our students to work on advanced technologies and make them as innovative, aspiring Engineers and Entrepreneurs rather than being mere engineering graduates is what the Management is striving to do, with the ardent help of our very talented faculty & other staff members of GAT.
Maintaining quality standards and ensuring that every graduating student is readily employable with holistic skill, clarity, and critical thinking in their chosen field of Engineering and Technology is our goal. I am glad to note that our students have been maintaining excellent standards of discipline and attention to their academic standards.
I encourage all the students to fully use the facilities and the serene ambience provided in this green campus to sharpen one’s professional and personal abilities. Let me jog your memory that: “Education is not about filling pail, but it is about kindling the fire dormant within you”. A step into the GAT is a right step into a brighter world of education and a knowledge hub.
The students graduated from GAT are placed in reputed industries successfully across the globe and they are our true ambassadors. I am really honoured and inspired to be a part of this successful journey where our efforts pave the way for all round development of the students during their stay at GAT.
With best wishes

```Dear Students,
I am very happy to meet you through this page. Global Academy of Technology has stood above the rest in its approach to its education and in its pedagogies. The methods we used to teach and the ways by which our students learn
are unique and creative. Consistently, we never hesitated to investigate our deficiencies and transform us to an agent of social change. The institute has substantially contributed to the process of National building by
providing quality education and thereby enabling the students to become globally competent. We have plans and dreams in the years to come. We propose to introduce Academic Audit for every department by external experts.
This aims at regular scrutiny of the quality teaching and the content of teaching.
Education is not an act of acquiring knowledge but learning a skill to lead life and forming one’s personality. This is an ennobling process of growth. I can boldly say that we have excelled in every initiative that we undertook,
and we have stood together in facing the challenges in realizing quality education. In all this, we have made every effort to be sensitive and compassionate to the marginalized and the people in need.
Growing Ahead of Time ....
My best wishes to all prospective students and regards to the parents for having bestowed their faith in us.
Remaining at your service 24X7,

```For India to become the world’s technology hub, we need to lead from the front in our understanding of cutting-edge methods, knowledge- driven management and implementation capability. With India metamorphosing into one of the fastest growing economies, job creation and skilling seem to be natural tools to ensure sustainable growth. The onerous responsibility of producing engineering graduates who are employable lies with the engineering institutions. Employability does not mean that a student should be placed in an industry before he/she leaves the portals of an institution. Employability means equipping engineering graduates with necessary technical skills, communication skills, leadership qualities, soft skills, professional ethics and a social responsibility.
Global Academy of Technology (GAT) has understood the need for integrating meaningful research activities with academics to enhance the scholastic standards in teaching and the quality of output. The management of the GAT has determined to promote research and consultancy activities in association with industries and national/ international institutions of repute. Management of GAT has constituted a RESEARCH ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) to guide the institution with a clear focus on the way the activities of research and consultancy must progress. Research and consultancy policies have been drafted and approved by the management to enable and motivate the faculty to undertake research and consultancy activities.
The present focus of GAT is to improve the laboratory infrastructure by bringing new industry relevant technology to enable higher level of learning in students, foster integrated learning by providing multiple industry relevant interfaces, enable students to take up industry relevant projects and encourage faculty to take up research by providing ability to add customer logic.
As a part of institutional social responsibilities, institutes should incubate technological startups by providing facilities such as office space, technology and lab support, infrastructure support, industry interface, exposure to the investor community, financial management support, legal support on Intellectual Property Rights and Patents, and other such assistance so that the startups can get guidance and mentoring during the incubation to overcome the initial hurdles with ease in starting the business. These centers can bridge the gap between industries and educational institutions. Students collaborate with companies on campus for internships and projects and develop technological products which can have an impact on industry and society. Efforts are on to start an incubation center in the institute. GAT Incubation Center envisages to have tie-ups with industries/ alumni/ multinational companies/ institutes of repute through which the activities of incubation can be strengthened. The institute has already signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with twenty industries and institutes of repute.
Students of GAT with an entrepreneurial bent of mind are advised to utilize this opportunity to enable themselves to become successful entrepreneurs.
Let me conclude my thoughts with a Chinese saying - "If a man is hungry do not give him a fish; make him learn the art of fishing"
Wishing the Research fraternity and students of GAT all the very best.

Placement for any student is a vital part of the degree course irrespective of the stream and career path. It’s hard to put into words how grateful I’m for our Placement department and placement officers to have contributed to me and my peers. In a nutshell, our placement department makes every effort to equip us for placement season right from our first year of engineering. Technical, soft skills, group discussion, you name the skill, they’ve got you covered with their extensive and well researched training program. I truly think that is the real game changer. Covid created a wave of uncertainty in all our lives, especially me. I was really anxious about the job market and about the reaction from the IT industry

For us, this means to have a deeper industry linkage than ever before, creating a research culture from day one and ensuring seamless education using the best technology available anywhere. I will continue to do all that it takes to ensure the best job opportunities through career focused education for our student. The excellent infrastructure, teaching faculty of the best kind of the Department ensuring quality education such as interaction among students, parents, and staff, along with a Training and Placement Cell ensures a bright future to its students. The Department of ISE is striving hard towards the goal of providing innovative and quality education with high standard to achieve academic excellence and provides platform for the students to achieve their career goals.
Our Department has produced hundreds of professionals and has established a name for itself in the country and abroad. They have consistently excelled in the highly competitive industrial environment in top-ranking companies. I attribute this success to the winning combination of a dedicated faculty that works hard at imparting quality education, a well- planned syllabus and finally, our students. I strongly believe that learning never ends with the acquisition of a degree.
It is a life-long process, especially because of steady and rapid advances in computing technologies shorten the life of tools and techniques prevalent today. Obsolescence begins when learning ends. Our students are given a strong foundation in information science and problem-solving techniques and are made adaptable to changes. Come and join us and be part of our accomplishment.

Solar Chargeable E - Rikshaw
An Electric Vehicle has number of advantages over IC engine vehicles. The main advantage is that an EV has nothing to do with rise in fuel price. Another important advantage is that EVs contribution to the environment pollution is much less. Our vehicle stands different from other EVs by the fact that it can be charged by solar energy. Hence the vehicle is completely using Green energy.
The vehicle specially designed to carry both passengers and also goods. This is achieved by foldable seat mechanism. The pay load capacity is around 800Kgs including the vehicle weight. The vehicle chassis was fabricated with the help of mechanical department at Global Academy of Technology. The body is fabricated using 1mm MS steel sheet. The vehicle is powered using a Brushless DC motor. Motor is coupled with differential connected across both the back tyres of the vehicle. The motor is powered using a Lithium-ion battery, which gives the range of 100km/charge. We can achieve a maximum speed of around 25-30km/hr. In absence of sunlight, battery can be charged by plug-in charger too.
The vehicle is also given a modern touch by installing some smart features like Automatic headlights, Automatic Wipers, Reverse parking system, Digital instrument cluster, and Automatic braking.
There are 4 solar panels mounted at the top of the vehicle. All the 4 panels are connected in series.
The MPPT controller optimizes the match between the solar array and the battery, hence the battery is charged efficiently. The safety of battery is also taken care by MPPT charge controller during charging.
The vehicle can be effectively used for many applications such as for delivery agents and can be used for farmers for various agricultural use. The vehicle turns out as a boon to the auto drivers which turns out to be cost-effective than regular autos.
The student team has participated in 6th National Level Techno-Exhibition which was held at “Dr. Ambedkar Institute Of Technology”, Bangalore on 13th April 2022. Our team won 2nd prize in this competition and we received a cash prize of Rs 50,000/-
The students also participated in 8th National Level Technical Project Exhibition held at “Saintgits college of Engineering “, Kottayam , Kerala on 25th and 26thApril. The students of Saintgits college also admired the vehicle. The vehicle photos were published in Manorama Newspaper and Mathrubhumi Newspaper. Interview on our vehicle was taken by RJ Jeena on club FM 4.3.

To comprehensively look at the historical evolution of these issues and address them requires extensive study of past work and meetings with experts. We are assessing the water resources of Bangalore and started with Vrishabhavathi Valley and the Vaderahalli Catchment area. Over 104 lakes have been surveyed and 40+ lakes are being monitored for the water quality.
A geospatial approach for sustainable water resources management – A case study of Bengaluru (on-going project)
The focus of the project is to evaluate the quantity and quality of available water resources in Bangalore using geospatial technology. The project is funded under Respondscheme (39.71 Lakhs) by ISRO

Tender Sure Impact Study Report Submission to Sri. N Manjunatha Prasad, IAS, BBMP Commissioner (2017)
Scope of Pedestrianization at Church Street Study Report Submission to Sri. BH. Anil Kumar, BBMP Commissioner (2019)
Pedestrianisation is a local scale rapid transition that is happening globally, with potentially transformational consequences for how we live, work, play and breath in cities across the world. Most of the Indian cities are in a shift in urban planning, away from the dominance of cars, and towards pedestrianisation and more human scaled city development. Govt. of Karnataka has taken many initiations in this regard. Church Street, Banglore has been reshaped towards the pedestrian plaza model with the intention to make the street more pedestrian friendly. Department of civil engineering has assigned to perform the impact studies and scope of pedestrianization at Church Street by BBMP.
Civil department has assigned to perform Comprehensive Traffic Studies at High-Density Corridor by Bengaluru Traffic Police. Department has successfully completed the project and the study finding has been submitted.```
